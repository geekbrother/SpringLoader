# ðŸŒˆ SpringLoader [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/spring-loader.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/spring-loader)

Gradient spring animated loading activity indicator component for React Native. 

The animation is created in pure [reanimated2](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) and [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG).

It's lightweight, made in TypeScript, and can be used in the Splash screen (unlike Lottie and Rove animations).
